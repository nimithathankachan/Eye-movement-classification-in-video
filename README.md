# Eye-movement-classification-in-video
To classify different eye movements like blink, left, right, centre, up, and down in video using convolutional neural networks.Proposed architecture employs deep neural networks that run in parallel, for both eyes separately for visual feature extractions using preprocessed dataset of different eye movement images.


How to run the code
1)The file for facial landmark detection is “shape_predictor_68_face_ landmarks.dat”. This can be found in internet.
2)The FINAL2 folder contains the dataset of eye images of up, down, right, centre, left, open and close. You can download and unzip  to use
3)3class model creation contains the code for model creation for right, centre and left classification. You can use the dataset in FINAL2 for training.
4)5class model creation contains the code for model creation for right, centre, up, down and left classification. You can use the dataset in FINAL2 for training.
