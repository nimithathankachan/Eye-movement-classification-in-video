# Eye-movement-classification-in-video
To classify different eye movements like blink, left, right, centre, up, and down in video using convolutional neural networks.Proposed architecture employs deep neural networks that run in parallel, for both eyes separately for visual feature extractions using preprocessed dataset of different eye movement images.

IMP: The file for facial landmark detection is “shape_predictor_68_face_ landmarks.dat”. This can be found in internet.
